# Accessibility Assistant

## Introduction

Accessibility Assistant is a Python application designed to bridge communication gaps for individuals with disabilities. It utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to provide functionalities such as sign language recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and speech-to-text conversion. By leveraging technologies like TensorFlow, Mediapipe, and Keras, Accessibility Assistant aims to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in communication for people with disabilities.

## Code Explanation

The codebase consists of several Python scripts that implement the different functionalities of the Accessibility Assistant:

- `main.py`: Contains the Streamlit application code for the user interface and integrates the various functionalities.
- `functions.py`: Defines functions for performing sign language recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and speech-to-text conversion using Mediapipe, gTTS, and SpeechRecognition libraries.
- `models/`: Directory containing the pre-trained machine learning models used for sign language recognition (prediction.h5).
